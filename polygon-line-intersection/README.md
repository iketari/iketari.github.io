### A polygon and a line intersection problem
The goal of this exercise is to take a polygon defined by the points 'points', use the mouse
events to draw a line that will split the polygon and then draw the two split polygons.
In the start, you'll have the initial polygon

![Start](start.png?raw=true "Title")

While dragging the mouse, the polygon should be shown along with the line you're drawing

![Mouse move](mouseMove.png?raw=true "Title")

After letting go of the mouse, the polygon will be split into two along that line

![Mouse Up](mouseUp.png?raw=true "Title")

The code provided here can be used as a starting point using plain-old-Javascript, but it's fine
to provide a solution using react/angular/vue/etc if you prefer.
